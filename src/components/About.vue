            I taught myself how to build websites with the help of "View Source"
            on GeoCities, detoured with an art & design degree, but finally made
            my way back to the web (don't ignore what you did for fun as a
            kid!). Now in my career, I'm able to use my design background to be
            a product-minded frontend software engineer.

            As a product-minded engineer I am curious about seeking to
            understand the project in order to see all the options and edge
            cases before writing any code. From mock-ups to architecture I like
            organized and consistent structure that won't make a user second
            guess what to do next. I find there are always ways to speed things
            up and do regular refactors as I learn and grow.
